# Horse Racing Data Analytics

## Introduction
horse_racing_study is an academic end-to-end data science project focusing on the domain of horse racing. The goal of the project is to produce a machine learning model to be able to understand the many factors that can contribute to horse racing performace. Data is gathered by scraping full result pdfs from [Equibase.com](https://www.equibase.com/), a website that hosts results, reports, and statistics on thoroughbred horseracing. Data is then transformed into Pandas Dataframes to be used in machine learning models. 

## Progress
  - [X] Gather Data
  - [X] Extract and Load Data
  - [ ] Transform Data
  - [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis
  - [ ] Build ML & Predict
  - [ ] Final Write Up 
  
 More in depth progress on an item by item basis is tracked on the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/Jonhops1595/projects/2/views/1)
 
 An [Initial Project Plan](Initial_Project_Plan.pdf) was also created at the start of Fall 2022 which contains a high level overview of the end-to-end workflow of the project.
 

## SubSections
  - [Domain Learning](Horse_Racing_Domain_Learning/README_Domain.md) contains all the information used to learn more about horseracing, handicapping, and how to read PP/Result cards. 
  - [Downloading of PDF Files](PDFDownloader/README_Downloader.md) contains the code used to download the PDFs from Equibase to then be stored on our shared Google Cloud storage bucket.
  - [Scanning of PDF Files](PDFScanner/README_Scanner.md) contains the code used to scan the result pdfs and extract data needed for the model.
